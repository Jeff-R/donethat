# DoneThat is a work logger

It consists of a Rails app and a command-line client; the client script monitors the file system, and notifies the web app each time a file changes.

I think of time tracking as being like backups; It should just happen automatically. I don't want to have to rely on any manual process.

Eventually this should do that, but it's very raw now. It records events, but that's all so far.
